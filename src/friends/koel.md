bio: Koel is a Mumbai based filmmaker and live video artist. Trained at the Film
  and Television Institute of India (FTII) and La FÃ©mis, Paris, Koel uses her
  unique training and sensibility to bring a nuanced approach to live video.
  Aided by tools like Resolume Arena, Touch Designer and a plethora of MIDI
  controllers, she has the ability to transform spaces by reimagining them
  visually and mapping perfect projections to complement the music & performance
  art. Her content is a mix of archival and self-shot footage with intricate
  geometrical patterns and quixotic, quirky shapes, all manipulated live and in
  real time via MIDI.
