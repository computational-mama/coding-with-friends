bio: Suvani is an artist and researcher based in Delhi, India. Actively engaged
  in thinking through the techno-political processes that listening is embedded
  in, she is drawn towards its generative and speculative possibilities. She
  works with sound and inter-media assemblages and has been exploring various
  modes of transmission to investigate and recompose the concepts, histories,
  fictions, myths, sensations and intensities that the aural carries and
  reveals.
