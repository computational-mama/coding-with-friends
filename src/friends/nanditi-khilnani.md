bio: Coming from a technology, management & training background at Google,
  Nanditi combined her artistic interests to explore intersectional spaces of
  art-tech to build management & technological solutions for arts & creators
  through her work at Ajaibghar. She has also led efforts on organisational
  setup, strategy, programming, and outreach for cultural organisations focused
  on indigenous music & arts. As a classically trained Indian vocalist &
  contemporary guitarist, Nanditi has now ventured into the growing Algorave
  movement (live-coded generative music). Performing music with code, she has
  developed Raga-based electronic music along with building learning resources
  for children to develop musical and coding skills together.
