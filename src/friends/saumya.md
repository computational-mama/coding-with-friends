Saumya was also part of our summer 2020 informal cohort of womxn learning to code together. Saumya is secretly kind of a math whiz. Her experiments with code and graphics showcase her strong understanding of layouts and typography. 

She had been posting a lot of interesting hand painted textures which she was turning into collages and was looking to port that experiment on p5js as well. 

At the time, she was excited about the collage making process of [Korma Dima](https://www.instagram.com/dimakorma), they were using collages at various scales from small postcard sizes right up to big wall installations. 

Before the episode, Saumya created some hand drawn textures on her iPad, which we used in the stream. The centre image in the reference section is a set of 13 square textures she made for the session.
