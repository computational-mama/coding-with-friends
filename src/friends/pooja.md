I've known Pooja for more than 15 years (just about half my life time). Her excitement and expertise with typography has always been a source of inspiration for me. She has been documenting Indian lettering for a while now, and host an archive of sorts here: [Indian Street Lettering](https://indiastreetlettering.com/).

We wanted to explore if we could try one character of a new typeface purely on p5js. The letterform was to be look like these beautiful mosaic letters in the references. These were found in Ahmedabad on a bench, the script is Gujarati. 

This was a tough challenge and eventually we gave up after about streaming for two hours. We managed to conjure an "H" of sorts at the end of it.
