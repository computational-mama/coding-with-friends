Anisha was the first guest on Coding with Friends. It was an informal invitation I made to her that she graciously accepted. Along with some other amazing womxn, Anisha and I had been meeting few days a week in the summer of first lockdown in India (around July-August 2020) to learn [p5.js](https://p5js.org). It was amazing to see the ways in which she was adapting p5.js to be visual practice. You can see more of her amazing work on the Instagram link in the profile above.

Anisha wanted to start exploring the basics of 3D in p5.js. She was interested to see if we could try a simple experiment with some design elements from the [Theyyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theyyam) headdress.
