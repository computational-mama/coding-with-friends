Coding With Friends, reinforces these ideas of care, sharing and connectedness, which no other activity could have given. Building these non-conforming, non-organisational and often non-agenda driven communities with other womxn has now become a driving force of my practice. What could be more exciting than extending warmth and care through a positive shared experience? What could be more provocative than to build soft, understated and rooted networks of womxn creators? What can be more powerful than relationships built in safe, creative environments? 
The project will gives an opportunity for the live coding communities and practices around live coding and creative computation to make space for coding as a simple shared activity (that is not attached to big performances), and assess notions of care within their practice.
