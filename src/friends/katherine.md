Katherine and I got talking about a book she was reading called "A Dictionary of Hong Kong English". The book resonated with me, as several words were from our shared colonial pasts. Hers living in Hong Kong and mine in India. She also spotted some words in the dictionary that had roots in Hindi. 

She wanted to work with a loupe that reveals hidden meanings and created a list of places in Hong Kong with the chinese and english names.
