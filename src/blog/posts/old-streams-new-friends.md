Today I invited the past guests from coding with friends for an informal chat and conversation. 

It was just no agenda kind of meeting where all of us just got together and had some conversation the five past guests from the streams were not familiar with each other except for Anisha and Pooja who overlapped some years ago at the same design studio it was nice for them to sort of interact with each other in and learn about each other outside of the scope of just work Catherine requested Pooja for a viewing of a bookshelf which was so nice to see because Puja has an amazing collection of books Anisha spoke about her cat its vaccination and some other fun activities she had done with her nephew in Kerala

Catherine spoke about moving back to the US to continue her studies and a new internship that she has at fathom

Anushka told us about her interest in in old Indian TV show called Alif Laila which is based on the Arabian nights

The discussions varied from design to guillotine and torture weapons

Eventually the conversation lead to pockets how that is so essential to clothing and yet women never tend to have pockets in that we discussed how women used to carry their money wallet and keys in the past in India it’s common to tuck them in your blouse close to your chest

We spoke about several other things in between and the conversation when in its own direction with no obligation to speak about work

Eventually I told them about upcoming streams and the guests that I’m invited it was nice to share that with them and to see where things can lead

Pooja also mentioned that she and typography colleague of hers are considering a similar series of typography with friends and I love the idea that this allows for any activity that you can do with others conversation builder to bring people together and to just enjoy ourselves while we do something interesting
